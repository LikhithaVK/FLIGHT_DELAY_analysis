#Flight Delay Analysis

#ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes flight performance using a synthetic dataset of airline operations. It focuses on departure delays, arrival delays, and cancellations, with breakdowns by airline, time of day, and reason for disruption.

The Excel file (flight_analysis.xlsx) includes raw flight data, summary tables, and a dashboard structure for visualization.

ðŸ“‚ File Structure

synthetic_flight_delays (2)
Raw dataset with detailed flight-level data.

FlightDate â†’ Date of the flight

Airline â†’ Airline name

FlightNumber â†’ Flight identifier

Origin / Destination â†’ Airports

ScheduledDeparture â†’ Planned departure time

TimeSlot â†’ Part of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)

DepartureDelay / ArrivalDelay â†’ Delay in minutes (can be negative if early)

Cancelled â†’ Binary flag (1 = cancelled, 0 = operated)

CancellationReason â†’ Cause of cancellation (e.g., Weather, Carrier, Security)

DelayCause â†’ Cause of delay (e.g., Late Aircraft, NAS, Weather)

Distance â†’ Flight distance in miles

DayOfWeek â†’ Day of week (1 = Monday, â€¦, 7 = Sunday)

Aggregated performance summary:

Average departure delay per airline

Average arrival delay per airline

Cancellation counts per airline

dashboard
Placeholder for visual analytics (charts, KPIs, etc.).

ðŸš€ How to Use

Open the Excel file in Excel / Google Sheets / Power BI / Tableau.

Use the synthetic_flight_delays (2) sheet for raw data analysis.

Explore sheetdesign for airline-level summaries.

Build custom dashboards in the dashboard sheet or external BI tools.

ðŸ“Š Possible Analyses

Compare airlines by average departure/arrival delays.

Identify peak delay periods (by TimeSlot or DayOfWeek).

Study most common causes of delays and cancellations.

Correlate flight distance with delays.
